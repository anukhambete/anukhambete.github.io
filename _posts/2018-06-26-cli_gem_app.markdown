It took me a while to pick a topic for my CLI gem app. I wasn’t able to move past the initial suggestions of scraping websites related to movies so I kept thinking of different ways in which I could make a movie or music app that was still distinct from the examples given. I finally decided to move onto a completely different topic and picked a Stock Screening website. 

The Website – Finviz.com provides the user with information about stocks listed in the U.S. on several indices such as the NYSE and NASDAQ. The information provided is displayed in various formats. The site includes a color coded map with information about a stocks performance based on a specific time period. 

For my Stock-CLI-App I decided to work with the information from the stock screener instead and picked companies listed on the NASDAQ that have a Market Cap that’s greater than 200 billion U.S. dollars.

The app gives the user four choices

1)	**View a list of stocks and their symbols.**

The first choice displays the list and allows the user to enter the symbol of a stock in order to gain more information about the stock such as : Earnings per share, Major Indices and the Market Capitalization.
After displaying the information it returns to the main menu.

2)	**View a list of companies sorted by market cap**

The second choice allows the user to view a list of companies in descending order of Market Cap

3)	**View a list of companies sorted from most to least volatile for the day**

The third choice allows the user to view the stocks from most volatile to least volatile for that day

4)	**Quit the app**

The last option allows the user to exit the application.
