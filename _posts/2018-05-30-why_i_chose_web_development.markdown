I grew up in a typical middle-class family, surrounded by accountants and doctors and when the time came my parents expected me to conform and choose one of the two. Production Engineering was hardly a form of rebellion but my choice to forego the promise of a stable career in finance or medicine seemed confounding to my parents.
As an engineer I developed an appreciation for approaches that were rooted in critical thinking and were supported by logic and constant experimentation. 

My first year as an undergraduate student was when I first encountered computer programming. Owing to the lack of proper resources, I wasn't able to dedicate enough time to learning more about it and understanding its various applications. After I graduated, I began work at a bank and assumed that through the course of my career I'd learn different aspects of finance and banking. I moved on from banking to obtain a masterâ€™s degree in Operations Research and worked thereafter at a litigation consulting firm. Through the years, I noticed that although I had no formal background in Computer Programming my dependency on coding as a necessary tool grew manifold. Not only did I use programming languages to complete assignments, but I also had to rely on it for statistical calculations and analyses at work. 

The shift towards Web Development was gradual. At first, I started looking into courses for languages that I was somewhat familiar with like R and SQL. I looked into doing some courses online just to get better acquainted with how online courses work and what sort of career paths one might take after. As I read more about Web Development I felt like it was the right fit. Although web development is disparate and not related to my previous choices there's a sense of familiarity given its obvious and necessary reliance on logic and reasoning. 

I'm uncertain as to where this path will lead yet I'm confident in my choice to switch careers and look forward to becoming a developer.
